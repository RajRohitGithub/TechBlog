				<h2>Java Deep Backend Developer!!</h2>

				<p>Hello, I'm Rohit Kumar Rajbhar. I've completed my education
					at Government Inter College Lalkuan in Nainital, where I
					successfully passed my 10th and 12th-grade exams. I further pursued
					a diploma in Computer Science and Engineering from Government
					Polytechnic College in Kaladhungi, Nainital, Uttarakhand. I
					originally hail from Atraul Pandey in Mau, Uttar Pradesh, and now
					call Lalkuan, Nainital, Uttarakhand, my home. I have gained
					valuable experience during a 9-month internship as a Java backend
					developer. My passion extends beyond coding, as I find joy in
					playing the bandmital and exploring new places, including
					international 'travel. Throughout my journey, I've had the
					privilege of collaborating with diverse teams to create innovative
					solutions.</p>
